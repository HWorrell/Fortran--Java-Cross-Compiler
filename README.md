# Fortran--Java-Cross-Compiler
Senior Project final source code

This is a personal copy of my senior project group submission.  It is a Fortran->Java Cross Compiler, sponsered by Dr. Kenneth Hoganson of Kennesaw State University.

The program takes in a single Error-Free Fortran Source code file, and produces as output a single, logically equivilent source code file in Java.

The program is not especially robust, and requires a set of conventions that must be adhered to in the Fortran code.

Ideas for future expansion:
1) Expand the parsing to allow for a greater range of Fortran code.
2) Additional error handling.
